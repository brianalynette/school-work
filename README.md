any assignments/projects worked on at UVic

Here you will find my work from second year learning to code in C, and extending my Python knowledge.

In all seng265 folders I wrote the code for the icsout_._ files, however all other code was written by my professor (the tester files and .ics files)

In seng265/a1/iscout.c I wrote all code except for lines 250-272.
